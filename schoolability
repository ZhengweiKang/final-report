Reporting in subsequent periods was changed to reflect operating costs of the property as Auxiliary enterprises, particularly as the majority of the property was to be focused on housing, retail, and conference and events activities.  If 2011-2012 reporting were adjusted to reflect operating costs of the property on an apples-to-apples basis within the Auxiliary Enterprises category, expenses in the Auxiliary Enterprises category would have been down by 32% rather than up by 14% (similarly, on a per FTE basis, costs would have been down 14% rather than up 42%).","As indicated in Section 3, ""Cost Increase Explanation"", adjusting for the change in reporting regarding the mixed-use property acquired by the University, Auxiliary Enterprises would have been down by 32% (down by 14% on a per FTE basis).

While the majority of the debt issued was geared towards a major facility project, a portion of the debt related to IT infrastructure improvements and completion of an updated Master Plan for the University.  2013-2014 also saw the University embark on a comprehensive project to upgrade functionality of its Banner ERP system while also enhancing data analytics and reporting capabilities.  Allocated Information Technology costs within the Institutional Support category were up from 2011-2012 by $1.0 million.  With acquisition of the mixed-use Aloha Tower Marketplace property, the University incurred approximately $0.4 million of tax obligations, primarily related to the parking revenue generated at the property.  In 2013-2014, the tax expense was reported in the Institutional Support category, but would have been more accurately reported in Auxiliary Enterprises.

A core part of HPU's mission is to keep a quality education within the reach of our students. Prior increases in tuition rates were driven by HPU's continuing need to address the costs of operating a private university in Honolulu as well as the very real challenges facing universities across the country.    Regarding Fees:    Recently, several fees were introduced for various student driven reasons.    The student activity fee was introduced starting fall 2013 semester. The fee is used to fund major campus events planned by the Campus Activities Board, recognized student organizations, Student Government Association, and departments who reach out to the entire student body.    The Transportation Fee was introduced beginning fall 2015 for full-time undergraduate and graduate students who take classes at the Hawaii Loa and Downtown campus. The Transportation Fee (UPass) is a mandatory fee like the Student Activity Fee and Technology Fee which help provide activities and services for HPU students.

The primary reason that SLC is listed in the top 5% of the CATC change-in-net-price list is that it provided an extraordinary level of grant aid to entering students in Fall 2010  -- averaging $35,900 for students receiving need-based aid.  The $35,900 figure compares to average grant aid amounts approximating $31,000 in Fall 2009 and Fall 2011.       The financial need of the cohorts following the 2010 class was not as great as that of the Fall 2010 cohort.  Consequently, the average grant awarded to students returned to more typical levels: approximately $27,500-31,000 per year.  This change from the extraordinary grant level in Fall 2010 is viewed as an increase in net-price by CATC because its methodology: (1) makes no adjustment for perturbations in student financial need like the one experienced by SLC in 2010, and (2) does not correlate and weigh annual average grant aid against actual annual student average need in any particular year or timeframe.      Put plainly, the CATC's methodology exaggerates the actual change in net-price because of the one year fluctuation in the average grant aid awarded in Fall 2010, when SLC greatly increased its average grant aid to help a cohort with especially high financial need.  This appears to be an unintended and very unfortunate consequence of the CATC net-price methodology.  Perversely, the CATC suggests that there is a high rate of increase in net-price when a college takes extraordinary measures in one year to assist an especially needy cohort and then returns to standard levels of support when the need-profile of students returns to more normal levels.    In the years following Fall 2010, when the average grant decreased from the record-high $35,900, the college continued to offer generous average grants to an increasing percentage of the enrolling class.   In Fall 2010, 53% of the entering class received grant aid.  In Fall 2012, the percentage on grant aid reached 70%.  Because of the increase in percentage of enrollees with grant aid, 240 new students had a substantial grant package in Fall 2012 compared to 179 in Fall 2010.  In terms of tuition discount and total grant aid spent on first-year students, in Fall 2012 the college was on par with the total levels of grant aid provided in Fall 2010.",FALSE,7.5

In following years, when positions were not lost through attrition, a reduction in force was implemented to bring administrative costs in line with the funding model.  Senior Administration continues to monitor all positions, both faculty and staff, and make the necessary changes as enrollment and funding allow.","As noted on the previous form, a significant portion of the increase in costs was due to an increase in employer retirement contribution for employees.  The State of North Carolina dictates the employer retirement contribution and thus is beyond the control of the College.     Senior Administration continues to monitor all faculty and staff positions and make adjustments to coincide with enrollment and available funding.  The previous 3-Year % Change for Academic Support was 22% compared to the current year which is 12%, a positive change.  The 3-Year % Change for Student Services went from 7% previously to 27% currently.  Grant funds contributed to this change and will adjust once grant funds are depleted.  The 3-Year % Change for Institutional Support is similar, 8% previously and 11% currently.  Operation and plant maintenance accounted for 53% of the increase in Institutional Support from 2010-11 to 2012-13.  Because of the method in which the College allocates fixed costs (operation and maintenance of plant and depreciation) on the IPEDS report, as Academic Support, Student Services, and Institutional Support increase as a percentage of total cost when Instruction costs go down, Academic Support, Student Services, and Institutional Support are allocated more of the fixed costs.  Instructional costs have decreased from 2010-2011 to 2012-13 and consequently more of the fixed costs have been allocated to Academic Support, Student Services, and Institutional Support.",FALSE,"North Carolina General Assembly and State Board of Community Colleges determine tuition.

In 2010-2011, 29% of students received loans and the average amount was $3,054.  In 2012-2013, 15% of students received loans and the average amount was $1,993.  During 2012-2013, as a result of the high Cohort Default Rate of students, Western Piedmont Community College began an intensive financial aid counseling effort to help students develop financial literacy and understand how much money they could afford to borrow.  Consequently, students began borrowing less money through the Federal Direct Loan Program and the average amount of loans awarded came down.  This effort aims to help students complete college with less debt and less chance of default.    Another impacting factor on the net price increase at Western Piedmont Community College between 2010-2011 and 2012-2013 was the increase of $1,598 in weighted average for room and board and other expenses by living arrangement.  Western Piedmont Community College does not offer on-campus housing.  Room and board expenses are entirely off-campus and are not set by the College.  The figures provided are purely estimates and can fluctuate based on how they are calculated and the external sources providing supporting information.      The amount of net price increase from 2010-2011 to 2012-2013 is $3,128.  Over half of that increase is attributed to off-campus room and board expenses and almost all of the remaining difference is due to the decrease in the amount of loans students are assuming to complete their education.",TRUE,3.5

An increase was approved by the Board of Trustees for Winter 2010 - from $79 per credit hour (comparable to a per credit charge of $118.50 for semesters) to $81.75 per credit hour - but that increase was waived until Autumn 2012, when the College moved to a semester academic calendar.  The waiver-expiration caused the quarter-calendar charge to increase to $81.75 and that was annualized for semesters so a student would not pay more annually than they would in the quarter calendar.  This resulted in a tuition charge for semesters of $122.63 for Autumn 2012.  An increase that had been authorized for fiscal year 2013 was delayed in its implementation until the final term of the academic year within that fiscal year (Summer 2013) and the legislated increase allowed for FY 2014 was assessed effective Autumn 2013.

Fourteen credits was selected as an average and that was an increase over the average previously reported to IPEDS when the College was on a quarter system, causing an increase in the annual costs reported.   The switch to semesters, coupled with an improving economy, saw a steep drop in enrollment at the College resulting in the cost per FTE to increase over the 2011-2012 academic year while cost containment measures, particularly in areas of fixed costs, were being identified and implemented.    Columbus State Community College charged the same rate of tuition to its students for more than 5 years (Summer 2007 through Summer 2012), incurred no new debt over this same period or since, and has yet to charge a technology or other infrastructure fee while these fees have become commonplace at other Ohio community colleges.

As explained in more detail in the additional comments section, the increase in tuition and fees was largely due to a change in billing structure in an effort to be more transparent, and not due to a large increase in tuition and fees. It also was offset by a substantial increase in institutional funds.The end result is that the Net Price only increased 3% from 2011-12 to 2013-14.",TRUE,NA,NA,"As was the case last year, there are three important considerations relevant to the increased amount reported for tuition and fees from 2011-12 to 2013-14. The first is that the increase in reported tuition is due in large part to the university's efforts to be more transparent and affordable.     In 2012-13, the university restructured its tuition and fees so that there is a flat tuition rate for all full-time students. All fees are rolled into tuition, so there are no additional university fees. This pricing structure - called FHU Complete - improves transparency by allowing students and parents to know exactly how much a semester will cost going into the academic year because tuition is a fixed rate that is independent of student credit hours and includes all additional fees such as general fees, technology fees, lab fees, graduation fees, equipment fees, testing fees, and private instruction fees. This pricing structure is also intended to encourage students to take more credits per semester in order to graduate in fewer semesters without incurring additional charges for taking additional hours.    The second relevant consideration is that the university increased institutional aid to help offset cost through this transition to FHU Complete. Those additional institutional funds have only increased since last year's report. In the 2011-12 Financial Aid IPEDS report (C.04), $2,541,202  in institutional aid was awarded to First-Time, Full-Time students (FTFT), an average of $7,079 per student. In 2013-14, $4,006,466 was awarded to FTFT students, an average of $11,318 per student. That is an average increase of $4,239 per FTFT student in institutional aid. In the Financial Aid data submitted to IPEDS for 2014-15, the average institutional aid per FTFT student was $12,174.    The third relevant consideration is that the Net Price increase for FHU from 2011-12 to 2013-14 was only 3% due to no increases in tuition coupled with significant increases in institutional aid. The Net Price reported to IPEDS for 2011-12 was $16,257 and the Net Price reported to IPEDS for 2013-14 was $16,851, an increase of $594.    The increase in tuition that placed FHU in the top 5% is not related to a significant increase in line item costs, but instead to a restructuring of tuition and fees to be more transparent about the cost while also providing opportunity for increased affordability by allowing students to take more hours at the same fixed rate.",FALSE,5

Along with the necessary components to support the academic programs, the College continues to make additions to maintain a quality education and to ensure we are in compliance with all federal, state, and accreditor mandates.  However, the increased costs associated with College operations do not come solely at the cost of increased tuition and fees.  In fact, the annual percentage increase in tuition amounts to only a few hundred dollars annually.  The percentage of increase is relatively small because the base tuition for this private college is modest when compared to comparable small, private colleges.  While other colleges may reflect a smaller percentage increase, their increase equates to a larger dollar amount that each student must bear.   As the College grows and the higher education landscape changes, costs are controlled to the best of the institution's ability.

To make sure that our financial aid officers are up to day with regulations and requirements we send them on a yearly base to get training with the Department of Education. We also started to provide better kit supplies to our students along with the textbooks required. Seeing as our student demand was growing, our client services demand grew as well. To offer a more salon experience to our students and our clients we purchased more salon equipment for our school. Thus, increasing our tuition was the solution to better serve our students. Also, with inflation of the economy our expenses to keep the school going rose too.
